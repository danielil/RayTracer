Requirements

C++17 conforming compiler.

Limitations
------------------

This software RayTracer is entirely educational. It is incorrect with respect to physical dimensions. It is also very slow and inaccurate. This is very basic work that I will try to improve upon greatly as I keep learning about RayTracing techniques.
